## Do this if you want to access more personalized study notes that I wrote on Notion ❗❗
- Create a Hashnode article on any topic that you are interested in! This is [guideline to start](https://support.hashnode.com/en/articles/6420128-creating-a-personal-blog-on-hashnode)!
- Some sample topics could be: "How is it feel like as Year 1 CS student?", "Challenges I face during Year 1 study in USM", "Apps that help in my study", etc.
- No word limitation.
- It could be technical or non-technical.
- After publishing the article, please notify me through teohsinyee.cs@gmail.com.
- **Don't wait for perfect timing. You just need to start! ✅**

## Side note
- Create an [issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue) ticket if you have any questions or problems. I will respond to it as soon as possible. 
- Make good use of the [writing syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)!
- Have fun!
